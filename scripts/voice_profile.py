"""Analyse the user's OWN best-performing posts to extract their voice.

This is the onboarding step that makes the writing theirs instead of generic.
The agent asks the user for posts they are proud of (ideally 100k+ impressions),
pastes them into a file, and this script measures the things that are actually
copyable:

  * length habit, and whether the account is on the 280 free-tier ceiling
  * how the hook is built (first 3-6 words) - the single highest-leverage thing
  * paragraph rhythm: how many blank-line-separated beats per post
  * emoji / hashtag / link / number / question usage
  * recurring topics, ranked by frequency across the corpus

It deliberately does NOT judge quality or invent a style - it reports what is
measurably there. The agent turns this into references/voice-profile.local.md.

Input (any of):
  * JSON list of strings
  * JSON list of objects with a text-ish key (text, tweet, content, body)
  * plain text, posts separated by a line of --- or by a blank line
